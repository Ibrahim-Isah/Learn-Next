//Dynamic Routing

- In dynamic routing, You can add brackets to filename in other to make them dynamic
- I can also set folder names in square brackets for dynamic folder routing
- the double square bracket signifies optional catchAll routes. which helps display the default param
- When doing the catchAll routing, always give the params under query a default value to avoid having error
